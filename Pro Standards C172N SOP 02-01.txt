INTRODUCTION


OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

This checklist and the operation of the Cessna C172 is designed to meet the standards of professional aviation. The intent in to prepare pilots to the highest possible standards of aviation and professionalism.

The general philosophy is DO-VERIFY method of checklists. This means all the items are completed from memory prior to doing the checklist. Then the items are verified using the checklist. 

There are two categories of items, Tasks and Flows. Tasks are items to be completed by the pilot as soon as practical, in any order. Tasks are often more complex and require more attention than Flows. Tasks are all completed prior to doing the flow. Flows are quick patterns to change the configuration of the aircraft.

Once all tasks and flows are completed, the checklist can be preformed.

Checklists should always be performed in the following order:
	
	Memory Items 
	Quick Reference Items
	Emergency Checklist
	Abnormal Checklist
	Normal Checklist

When operating as a crew the PM (pilot monitoring) should conduct the checklists, to allow the PF (pilot flying) to maintain focus on flight path management. The PF should verify the tasks are complete, perform the appropriate flow, then call for the checklist from the PM.

When in the training environment the student will complete the checklist. To develop crew communication skills the student will verbalize the single pilot items and the instructor will verbalize the PF items.

AREAS OF VULNERABILITY 

Areas of vulnerability are times during flight which deviations are most likely to occur and require prioritization of flight path management. During Areas of Vulnerability all non-critical tasks should be deferred until the aircraft is in a stable condition.

Areas of Vulnerability:
	Taxi
	Takeoff
	Within 100’ of level off
	Landing
	Crossing Runways
	Steril Cockpit



THREAT AND ERROR MANAGEMENT

A threat is factor or condition that could result in an incident or accident.

An error is a mistake or slip by the pilot that could result in a deviation, incident or accident. 

A risk is a threat that has been identified, briefed and considered in the pilot’s plan
Aeronautical Decision Making

Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) is the term used to describe the Threat Model. ADM has the following key comports:
	
	Identify threats
	Gather data
	Plan / Act
	Communicate
	Debrief 

Identify Threats 

The most important skill in threat identification is situational awareness (SA). Without situational awareness anticipating, detecting, briefing and mitigating threats is impossible. Situational awareness is the ability to identify cause and effect in the environment you are operating in. SA applies to the entirety of the environment and not just inside the cockpit. Developing SA takes experience, time and dedication to threat and error management. 

As a place to start developing situation awareness, the FAA has given us risk identification models such as PAVE and 5Ps.

	Pilot(s) - recency, proficiency, skill level, experience, IMSAFE
	Aircraft - airworthiness, deferred maintenance items, suitability for the operation
	EnVironment - weather, airspace, complex airports, aircraft congestion
	External pressure - company, passengers, pilot motivations

	Illness
	Medication
	Stress
	Alcohol
	Fatigue
	Emotional Health

Anticipated threats are those that have been briefed by the PF. Unanticipated threats have not been briefed.

Gather Data

Once the threat has been identified, the PIC needs to collect information to better understand the risk being presented to the completion of the flight. We gather data by using crew resource management and single-pilot recourse management. Effectively expanding your team as the PIC is critical for the ADM process.

	Inside the plane
	Pilot monitoring or Instructor
	Passangers
	Aircraft Database
	iPad Database
	Company Manuals

	Outside the plane
	Air Traffic Control
	Company
	Flight Service Stations

Once information has been collected the PIC should conduct a risk analysis do formulate a plan of action. It is important to consider information bias when gathering data and conducting the risk analysis. Information bias finding data that supports the decision that you prefer to make instead of the decision that needs to be made.

Use the risk assessment matrix to analyze the severity of accepting the threat that has been presented. Consider the probability of the occurrence and the severity of the consequences if it occurred.
If the level of risk is acceptable to the PIC they can continue to the next step.


Plan
With all available information, the pilot can formulate a mitigation strategy to operate the aircraft in relation to the threat that is present. A decision must be made to continue the mission or not. If the mission is safe to continue, use the mitigation strategy to make a plan of action for operating the rest of the flight. 

Communicate
In a single-pilot environment, the pilot should communicate their plan and intentions with ATC, passengers and company as necessary. 

When operating with two pilots it is critical to create a shared mental model of the plan with the other pilot. Both pilots should understand the mission, means to accomplish the mission and the mediation strategy for the encounter threats. This includes delegating PF and PM duties as necessary.

Debrief
Once the threat has been resolved and in a low area of vulnerability, the decision making process should be evaluated and suggest ways to improve the ADM skills in the future. 

No Time Threats

No Time Threats require immediate pilot action to preserve life and property. No time threats include but are not limited to:
	
	Fire
	Smoke
	Medical Emergency
	Engine Failure below 1,000 feet AGL

After encountering an unanticipated threat the PF must fly the airplane. The flight path must be stabilized before proceeding with the TaEM model. 

	Fly the airplane
	Memory Items
	Establish PF/PM

Act
This is what you train for. Use your pilot skills to get the plane on the ground as safely and as quickly as possible. 

Communicate
If time permits make your intentions know and squawk the appropriate emergency code.

Debrief
Once the threat has been resolved and in a low area of vulnerability, the decision making process should be evaluated and suggest ways to improve the ADM skills in the future. 


Errors
An error occurs when a threat is not mitigated or a threat is introduced by the pilot. The model below show progressive development of threats in to aircraft accidents or incidents. 
			

The primary means for preventing threats is by briefing. However, if a threat occurs the PIC must be well-trained and proficient in their skills to prevent errors form developing. These skills include: general piloting, workload management, checklist usage, aircraft knowledge, workload management, CRM/SRM, and ADM.

If an error occurs the PIC must recognize and correct it immediately. Failure to do so will result in an undesired aircraft state. 

Failure to correct an undesired aircraft state may result in an accident or incident. The PIC must be able to recognize this situations early and correct them.

WORKLOAD MANAGMENT

The majority of aviation accidents are caused by degradation in situational awareness from being oversaturated. It is important for a pilot to be able to identify when they have become saturated and communicate with instructor or crew member.

Green level is an appropriate amount of stress that encourages peak performance. The pilot is able to stay ahead of the airplane with situational awareness and task management.

Yellow level is when the pilot begins to be task saturated, often in the areas of vulnerability, and is no longer easily able to divide attention between tasks. The pilot may miss signals from the environment, degrading situational awareness.

Red is when the pilot is no longer able to complete the required tasks for safe flight path management. At this point the pilot needs to stop, slow down, think, and prioritize tasks. Continuing without task prioritization will most likely result in a pilot deviation or accident. 

Magenta is when the pilot does not have a high workload but is missing environmental signals due to complacency. The pilot needs to recognize the distractions and prioritize tasks for safe flight path management.

FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY 

TASKS
MAINTENANCE STATUS 

Determine the if it is safe to apply power to the aircraft.

If maintenance is in control of the aircraft, or there is an inoperative item, applying power could damage the aircraft or cause injury to persons. 

To determine if it is safe to apply power check the following:

	1. DO NOT OPERATE tag on the throttle
	2. Aircraft Status by scanning the QR code
	3. Maintenance Irregularities 

If any of the three items are found it is not safe to operate the aircraft.
	
PASSENGER BRIEFING

The PIC is responsible for briefing the passengers aboard the aircraft. The following briefing items are required:
	
	Smoking
	Location of exits
	Use of safety belts
	Location and use of flotation devices
	Location of survival equipment
	Location of fire extinguisher
	Sterile Cockpit

Example: “This is a non smoking flight. Safety belts are required for taxi, takeoff and landing. Use them by inserting the metal fitting into the buckle. Lift the latch to release. There are three exits on the airplane. Two front doors, lift the handle to open the door, and the aft baggage compartment door. (If required) There are life jackets in the baggage compartment. Place them over your head and tighten the buckle. There is a fire extinguisher in between the front seats. Pull the pin and aim at the fire in a sweeping movement. During taxi, takeoff, climb and landing we will keep talking to essential items only to prevent distraction.”



CREW BRIEFING

The First Flight of the Day crew briefing is meant to establish positive communication for crew members. The following items should be briefed:

	Establish the PIC
	Positive transfer of flight controls
	Emergency operation duties and responsibilities

Example (Student Pilot): “I will be acting as PIC of the flight, however final authority will be with the instructor. We will use the three-step method to transfer flight controls. Initiated by saying ‘my flight controls’ verified by ‘your flight controls’ and confirmed by saying ‘your flight controls.’ During an emergency the pilot flying will continue flying while the pilot monitoring does the flow items and emergency checklist. Once the checklist is complete we can transfer controls if necessary.”
AIRWORTHINESS ACCEPTANCE

FAR 91.7 - The PIC is responsible for determining whether the aircraft is in a condition safe for flight. The PIC should begin by checking the aircraft status to verify the inspections are current, and the hobbs and tach time match.

Use the AVIATED acronym to check for the following inspections: 
		Annual
		VOR Check (if required)
		100 Hour
		Altimeter and Pitot Static System
		Transponder
		ELT
		Airworthiness Directives.

Additionally, The PIC should ensure the required documents are onboard the aircraft using the ARROWPC acronym. 
	The documents include: 
		Airworthiness Certificate
		Registration (Federal)
		Radio Operators Permit (International Operations)
		Operating Limitations
		Weight and Balance Data
		Placards
		Compass Card

The pilots documents are also required for airworthiness. 
	These documents include: 
		Pilot Certificate
		Current Medical
		Government Issued Photo ID
		Corrective Lenses (if required)
		Flashlight
		iPad with current data and at least 80% charge
		Backup Battery suitable to charge the iPad 
		Current Standard Operating Procedures
		Current Checklist

When using an iPad as primary means of aeronautical data you are required to have backup data in the event of iPad failure. Current GPS database, which includes a current SafeTaxi data base is sufficient for VFR. 

IFR operations require a second chart data base. This can be a second iPad or iPhone with a current database or paper copies for the departure destination and alternates. 

 The PIC should, by means of external inspection verify the required equipment of 91.205 are operational. If there is any inoperative equipment, the PIC should verify the deferral of the equipment is completed in accordance with 91.213(d) and does not interfere with the safety of flight. 

PREFLIGHT

FAR 91.103 - The following items are required preflight action:

	Runway Lengths
	Takeoff and Landing Distances
	Fuel Requirements
	IFR Alternates
	Weather Reports and Forecasts
	ATC Delays

The PIC should also be familiar with all available information including NOTAMs.

An external inspection of the aircraft should be completed in accordance with the POH before each flight.

BEFORE TAXI

TASKS
DEPATURE BRIEFING

Copy the ATIS / ASOS in preparation for the departure briefing.

The Departure Briefing should have the following information:

	Weather

	Brief the current weather, any associated hazards and implications on flight. Key items 			include wind, visibility, clouds, altimeter setting and low level wind shear.

	Departure Procedures

	Starting at the aircrafts present location, brief taxi route, hot spots, takeoff distance, 			runway lengths, emergency procedures on departure, and departure procedures.

	NOTAMS

	Review any NOTAMS effecting the departure.

	Threats

	Brief the greatest threats to the departure. Examples include, IFR conditions, CFIT, 			traffic congestion, LLWS and unfamiliar or complex procedures. Discuss ways to 			mitigate the threats. 

	Distractions to the pilot should also be considered. Distractions focus primarily on the 			pilot and human factors such a passengers and doing a sunset flight or tour.

Example: “Information BRAVO is current, Skies are clear, altimeter is 29.92 and there is a five knot crosswind from the left. We are at transient parking, we will taxi via HOTEL and ALPHA to runway 28R using cation for hotspot three. 28R is 4,598 feet long with a displaced threshold. We require 1,200 feet for takeoff. If there are any critical abnormalities, caution or warning messages on takeoff roll we will abort, stop the aircraft and assess the situation. Clearing the runway if possible. After takeoff, if there is an engine failure or fire will will do the appropriate memory item, followed by the checklist and plan to land off field. We are departing straight out to 3,500 feet. Our greatest on departure is traffic congestion in the pattern and incoming traffic from the coast. We will mitigate the threats by keeping our eyes outside and scanning for traffic.”


FLIGHT PLAN

The PF should build the flight plan in the GPS. If a clearance is associated with the departure procedures ensure that the procedure in built in the navigation system. After entering the appropriate waypoints the PF should verify the route on the map page. This will ensure there are no erroneous fixes entered. The PM or Instructor will verify the fixes. 

The PF should build the VNAV profile by entering the cruise altitude after the top of climb and entering patter altitude 1NM prior to the destination airport, for decent planning. For IFR flights the departure, arrival and approach procedures will contain VNAV information. The PF should enter the cruising altitude and verify the VNAV restorations match with a current instrument procedure chart.

The PF should also verify all LRUs are operational for every flight. For IFR flights the PF should ensure WAAS, RAIM or EPU will be available depending on the type of operations being conducted. 

Once the flight plan has been built and verified the PF should bug the flight instruments in accordance with the departure plan. This should include heading, airspeed and altitude.

FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS

Magnetic Compass - Ensure that the compass is visible and the case is full of fluid.

Airspeed - Should indicate zero with no head wind and match the ADI.

GI 275 ADI - Ensure the altimeter is set and within 75 feet of field elevations. Verify that attitude, heading, altitude, and airspeed are displayed normally on the ADI

Set Synthetic Vision as desired. 

Verify that no yellow or red battery icon is displayed on the ADI. If a yellow icon is present, verify the battery’s remaining capacity via SOP procedures.

Altimeter - Set the current altimeter setting and verify it is within 75 feet of airport elevation. This should be within 100 feet of the GI 275 ADI.

Turn Coordinator - Wings level, ball centered with no DC flag. The operation of the gyro can be checked on taxi.

GI 275 HSI - Choose the appropriate CDI source for navigation. If desired, select the map mode and set the range for taxi. Check for any advisory messages.

For IFR aircraft, verify that no yellow or red battery icon is displayed on the primary or standby ADI. If a yellow icon is present, verify the battery’s remaining capacity is more than 30 minutes.

VSI - Should indicate zero. If note zero, not the zero point. 


COMS / NAVS

COM 1 should be used to communicate with ATC for any instructions (Clearance, Ground, Tower, Approach, etc.) COM 2 should be used for advisory communications only (ATIS, ASOS, FBO, etc.)

Set the next frequency to be used in the Active portion of the radio and the next to be used in standby. 

COM 1 Active - Ground / Standby - Tower 
COM 2 Active - Guard 121.5 / Standby - Arrival ATIS

NAV should be set in the order of use for departure to include active and standby.

When making changes to COMs or NAVs, think ahead and enter the next appropriate frequency in the standby position when available.

FLOWS

NOT APPLICABLE 

CHECKLISTS



TAXI

The PF will taxi the airplane with no other duties or distractions while the aircraft is moving. During single pilot or training operations, the PF should stop the aircraft before going heads down for any reason. It is permissible for the PM to perform tasks while the PF is taxing such as programing radios or navigation. 

The PF should prioritize flight path management on the ground over checklists. The aircraft should be stopped or in a low area of vulnerability if the PF is to conduct checklists single pilot.

Perform a brake check before beginning taxi. 

Instrument Flight Deck Check

OVERVIEW
Check the flight instruments and systems to verify the aircraft is suitable for IFR flight.

OBJECTIVE
The pilot demonstrates satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with conducting a preflight check on the airplane’s instruments necessary for an IFR flight.

PROCEDURE
Verify the flight instruments, COMs and NAVs per Before Taxi Tasks.
Verify that the Magnetic Compass, HSI and turn coordinator move freely during taxi turns.
Verify the Magnetic Compass compared to a known heading. This is typically done aligning on the runway during the heading check.

COMMON ERRORS
Operating with inoperative equipment.
Operating with outdated navigation publications or databases.

COMPLETION STANDARDS
Perform preflight inspection by following the SOP procedures and determine that the airplane is in a condition for safe instrument flight.

BEFORE TAKEOFF

TASKS

The Before Takeoff Checklist is divided into two portions. Before Takeoff Checklist above the line and Before Takeoff Checklist below the line. The line segments the engine runup from pre-departure procedures. The Before Takeoff Checklist above the line references the runup which is associated with the Before Takeoff Flow. The above the line portion and run-up only need to be completed prior to the first takeoff of the flight. Subsequent departures or pattern work only require the below the line portion on the checklist. When complex departures are not being complied with the PF may choose to complete all tasks and flows and complete the before takeoff checklist in its entirety.

Turnoff the taxi light when parked to indicate to surrounding aircraft that you have no intention of movement.

For engine run-up, position the aircraft into the wind if possible. This will provide maximum engine cooling while parked.

Monitor tower frequency or CTAF in the runup area or approaching the hold short lines. Tune the next frequency to be used in the standby position. 

Verify the flight instruments have no red x’s, no flags and are configured for departure. This includes: airspeed bug, altitude bug, heading bug, CDI setting.

Verify that the MAG/TRUE navigation angle selection on the GI 275 and any interfaced navigators match.

Ensure NAV frequencies are tuned, active and standby, and the GPS is programmed accordingly.

The transponder should be set to VFR, appropriate discrete code as assigned by ATC or issued in an IFR clearance. 

Flaps should be confirmed or set for the appropriate takeoff configuration. 

Doors must be closed during runup and takeoff. It is permissible to have the windows open for runup and takeoff.

If departing into IMC conditions, turn the pitot heat on before takeoff.

Bugs

The flight instrument bugs should be set for departure.

Airspeed bug - Set for the appropriate climb speed
Altitude bug - Set for level off altitude
Heading bug - Set for the departure runway




FLOWS

Brakes - Hold
Flight Control Check - preform a box check to make sure no items in the cockpit are inhibiting the flight controls. Note iPad and kneeboard position.
Fuel Selector - Both
Trim - Set to the takeoff indication
Mixture - Rich
Throttle - 1700 RPM
Mixture - Adjust for density altitude above 3,000 to achieve peak RPM.
Magneto Check - Turn the ignition key to the R portion (2 clicks) and verify a drop in RPM of no more than 125. Return the key to BOTH. Turn the ignition key to the L portion (1 clicks) and verify a drop in RPM of no more than 125. The maxi difference should be 75 RPM. Verify the key is back in the BOTH position.
	
NOTE
A rough running engine during a magneto check indicates led build up and deposits on the spark plugs. This is most often caused by insufficient leaning during taxi. In some instances the magnetos can fail. This is often indicated by the engine dying during the magneto check or excessive drops of 500 RPM or more. To resolve fouled spark plugs, lean the mixture for peak RMP and increase the throttle to full power for one minute. After this procedure attempt a magneto check again. If it fails again return to parking and call maintenance.

Ammeter - Check alternator is charging. You can increase the load by turning on lights and pitot heat to verify the alternators ability to charge. 
Oil Pressure - Green
Oil Temperature - Green
Annunciators - Review displays for any abnormal warning, caution, or advisory indications.
Carburetor Heat Check - Apply carburetor heat and note a drop in RPM. Leave the Carburetor heat applied for Idle check.
Throttle - Full idle, verify the engine continues to run above 600 RPM. Close the carburetor heat.

CHECKLISTS



TAKEOFF

TASKS

Verify the correct runway with a runway sign or marking. Both pilots will confirm the correct runway. One pilot will confirm the runway by making a radio call to include the planed runway. The pilot that does not make the radio call confirms the runway by stating:
	
	“Runway _____ confirmed.”

Once aligned with the runway verify the heading bug is set for the departure runway.

	PF: “Heading checked.”
	PM: “Checked.”


FLOWS

Prior to crossing the runway threshold:

Lights - Set (All lights are on)
Mixture - Takeoff
Transponder - Altitude mode

CHECKLISTS

Not Applicable



CLIMB

TASKS

Flap Retraction

Flap retraction should be done at a safe altitude, at or above Vy. A safe altitude is 500 - 1,000 ft AGL. Below 500 ft AGL the pilot should be prepared for engine failure. Leaving the flaps extended above 1,000 ft could hinder climb performance.

Leaning

The mixture should be leaned above 3,000 MSL. Leaning technique for the climb provides a rough estimate before the fuel can be leaned precisely in cruise. At 3,000 MSL lean the mixture one inch travel or three rotations. Continue leaning one rotation per 1,000 ft

Lights

Leave all light on when climbing in busy areas with high traffic volume, to aid in collision avoidance. Otherwise, the Taxi and Landing lights can be turned off. The Strobe, Nav, and Rotating Beacon are required.

Pitot Heat should be used while in visible moisture.


FLOWS

AT 3,000 MSL

Mixture - Lean three rotations
Lights - Taxi and landing light off or leave on in congested airspace.
Pitot Heat - On in visible moisture.

CHECKLISTS


CRUISE

TASKS
Cruise Power & Leaning

Cruise leaning procedures should be in accordance with the POH using the performance data in Section 5.

Without EGT or CHT indicators, we can suggesting using RMP as an indication. 

Set the appropriate power setting from the POH. Slowly lean the mixture until there is a slight drop in cruise RPM. Increase the mixture three turns after the drop in RPM. This will result in a rich of peak lean.  

At the top of climb the fuel should be compared to the anticipated or planned fuel. Balance the fuel tanks if necessary. 

It is recommended to monitor guard on 121.5 while in cruise flight.

FLOWS

Power - Verify cruise power is being produced within the planned parameters. 
Lights - For high traffic volume areas leave all lights on. Otherwise, turn off the taxi and landing light.

Call out “UPSET”
Assess the energy state of the aircraft
Initiating the recovery is the primary objection - not troubleshooting why the upset occurred 

Step Two - Push
Unload the aircraft
Apply smooth and deliberate controls
Reduce AOA
Maintain until the stall has been broken
Don’t push too much - about 0.5g “light in the seat”

Step Three - Roll
After stall has been recovered from
Roll to wings level without adding elevator
Remain unloaded until the roll is complete
If the elevator is ineffective roll the plan to induce nose down pitch

Step Four - Thrust
Use thrust as required - Can be dynamic during the recovery
Full throttle may be necessary for recovery
Adding thrust will cause a pitch up moment

Step Five - Stabilize 
Return to a normal flight path and configuration
Use TEAM model 

COMMON ERRORS
Failure to seek assistance or declare an emergency in a deteriorating situation.
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.
Failure to interpret flight instruments.
Failure to unload the wings in recovering from high G situations.
Exceeding the operating envelope during the recovery.

COMPLETION STANDARDS
Use proper instrument cross-check and interpretation to identify an unusual attitude (including both nose-high and nose-low), and apply the appropriate pitch, bank, and power corrections, in the correct sequence, to return to a stabilized level flight attitude.

LOSS OF RELIABLE AIRSPEED

OVERVIEW

Loss of reliable airspeed can be very difficult to detect. Delay in detection will result in pilot induced loss of control in-flight. The airspeed indicator is malfunctioning due to instrument icing, blocking or system malfunction.

The GI 275 ADI will indicate yellow IAS miscompare or magenta ground indication if the ADC fails.

It is imperative that the pilot be familiar with control-performance methods.



PROCEDURE
Remove the erroneous airspeed from the instrument scan
Reference standby or groundspeed indications
Declare an emergency with ATC if in IMC
Maintain VMC if possible

COMMON ERRORS
Failure to maintain airplane control.
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.

COMPLETION STANDARDS
Demonstrate CRM/SRM and aircraft control.MANEUVERS
Pre-Maneuver Flow
OVERVIEW

TASKS

Weather

Copy the appropriate weather for the destination airport.

Flight Plan

Once copying the weather you can anticipate the landing runway and procedures. Update the GPS flight plan with any changes to approach and arrival procedures.

COMS / NAVS

COM 1 should be used to communicate with ATC for any instructions (Clearance, Ground, Tower, Approach, etc.) COM 2 should be used for advisory communications only (ATIS, ASOS, FBO, etc.)

Set the next frequency to be used in the Active portion of the radio and the next to be used in standby. 

COM 1 Active - Tower / Standby - Ground 
COM 2 Active - Arrival ATIS / Standby - FBO if needed

NAV should be set in the order of use for arrival to include active and standby.

When making changes to COMs or NAVs, think ahead and enter the next appropriate frequency in the standby position when available.

Arrival Briefing

 An arrival WANT briefing should be completed prior to beginning the initial decent.

	Weather

	Review the weather information identifying any threats. Set the current altimeter setting.

	Arrival Procedures

	From your current position, brief the arrival until the aircraft is parked. This includes: 			decent/arrival procedures, approach procedures, traffic pattern procedures, missed 			approach or go-around procedures, landing runway information, taxi routing, and 			parking.

	NOTAMS

	Review any NOTAMS effecting the departure.

	Threats

	Brief the greatest threats to the arrival. Examples include, IFR conditions, CFIT, 				traffic congestion, LLWS and unfamiliar or complex procedures. Discuss ways to 			mitigate the threats.

VFR Example: “Information Whiskey is current, wind is 180 at 10 knots, which is a strong left crosswind for runway 28L. Skies are clear and the altimeter is 30.07. Currently, we are 3,500 over Torrey Pines, we will contact tower and request touch and goes, then follow tower’s instructions inbound. Most likely this will be south of Mount Soledad to join the left traffic pattern at 1,400ft. It will be a short field landing on 28L that has 4,589 feet of available runway. If we have to go around it will be full power flaps to 20. After landing we will continue in the pattern. The only NOTAM is 28R is closed. High volume of VFR is the largest threat. We will mitigate this by looking outside and using proper scanning techniques.”

IFR Example: “Information Charlie…

LANDINGS

Normal and Crosswind Landing

Short Field Landing

Soft Field Landing

Power-Off 180 Landing

Instrument Landing

Missed Approach

Go-Around

Initiating a Go-Around

A Go-Around should be initiated any time at the discretion of the pilot flying (PF). Conditions that should automatically initiate a go-around include:
	
Unstable approach
Low-level Wind Shear (LLWS)
Traffic on the runway within 3,000 feet of the aircraft
ATC request
Collision hazard with aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, or wildlife

OVERVIEW
The landing approach is abandoned and the airplane is transitioned to a climb.

OBJECTIVE
To develop the student’s ability to correctly perform the go-around/rejected landing procedure.

PROCEDURE

The pilot flying initiates the go-around by making the standard call out, adding full power and being the flap retraction sequence. 

PF “Go-around, flaps 20”
Add full power
Retract flaps to the 20° position
Pitch for the horizon to level off and begin accelerating
Once there is a trend reversal on the VSI, retract flaps to 10° position
Radio intentions to ATC
Accelerating through Vy, retract flaps to 0° / UP position
Above 1,000’ AGL complete the climb checklist

COMMON ERRORS
Delayed recognition of the need for a go-around/rejected landing. Delayed performance of a go-around at low altitude.
Improper application of power.
Improper airplane configuration.
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife.
Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT.
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.

COMPLETION STANDARDS
PA.IV.N.S4	Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for 				VX or VY as appropriate +10/-5 knots.
PA.IV.N.S7	Maintain VY +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.
CA.IV.N.S4	Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for 				VX or VY as appropriate ±5 knots.
CA.IV.N.S7	Maintain VY ±5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.
Aborted / Bounced Landing

OVERVIEW
An aborted or bounced landing can occur for a variety of reasons:
Wind shear
Low-level turbulence
Excessive rate of descent
Excessive airspeed
Power not at idle during touchdown
Incorrect flare technique

OBJECTIVE
To develop the student’s ability to correctly recover from an aborted or bounced landing. 

PROCEDURE

Light Bounce Recovery Procedures

Maintain or reestablish landing attitude
Use power as required to soften the subsequent touchdown
Beware of increased landing distance

Increasing pitch attitude can lead to a tail strike

Severe Bounce Recovery Procedures

Do not attempt to land
Advance throttle to max power
Maintain pitch attitude until you begin to accelerate in airspeed and have a positive VSI trend
Trim
Follow normal go-around procedures

COMMON ERRORS
Tail strike from increasing pitch after a bounced landing
Delayed recognition of the need for a go-around/aborted landing.
Improper application of power.
Improper airplane configuration.
Collision hazards, to include aircraft, terrain, obstacles, wires, vehicles, vessels, persons, and wildlife.
Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT.
Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management.


COMPLETION STANDARDS
PA.IV.N.S4	Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for 				VX or VY as appropriate +10/-5 knots.
PA.IV.N.S7	Maintain VY +10/-5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.
CA.IV.N.S4	Apply takeoff power immediately and transition to climb pitch attitude for 				VX or VY as appropriate ±5 knots.
CA.IV.N.S7	Maintain VY ±5 knots to a safe maneuvering altitude.
AFTER LANDING

TASKS

In an effort to not block runway exits, first get a taxi clearance from ground control. When there is a moment of reduced work load or the aircraft is stopped complete the tasks, flows and checklist.

In CRM situations the PF should continue taxing while the PM completes the after landing items.

Flaps

During normal operations, when returning to parking set the flaps to 0. If there is a plan to taxi back to the runway for traffic patter work and the planned departure requires flaps 10, set them accordingly. 

The flaps may already be up after completing a short field landing.

FLOWS

Single pilot or PM performs the after landing flow.

Trim - Set to Takeoff
Mixture - Leaned one inch for ground operations.
Carburetor Heat - Off
Lights - Landing and strobe off. Taxi, Nav, and rotating beacon remain on.

SHUTDOWN / SECURE

TASKS

Securing the Aircraft

Tie or chain the aircraft and chock at least one wheel.


Post Flight

The post flight inspection should be completed in a similar fashion to the preflight inspection. The primary focus is to detect any damage that happened during the flight, for example looking for indications of a bird strike. 

In the event of another crew taking over the the aircraft, the next crew’s pre flight can substitute  for the post flight on the incoming crew. 

Any discrepancies should be written up and reported to maintenance.

Record the hobbs and tach in the flight log.
